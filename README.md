## What we will do in this short analysis:
- Explore a spatial single-cell pancreas dataset
- look at different cells types within the pancreas
- Look at where genes are located within certain cells
- Look at clusters and gene expression 
- Run a quick differentially expressed gene analysis
- Visualize DEGs with a volcano plot
- Allow you to explore the dataset on your own
